# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Python-SQL-Power-Bi-Project

***Project Name :*** Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Data Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis project to monitor hospital performance, wait times, and patient demographics. This project transforms raw data into an interactive Power BI Dashboard using Python for ETL and SQL for data warehousing.

# 📊 Project Overview

Goal: Improve ER efficiency by analyzing patient traffic, wait times, and satisfaction scores.

Result: A dynamic dashboard allowing stakeholders to track KPIs and drill down into granular patient details.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Seaborn): Data cleaning, feature engineering (Age Groups, Time Slots), and exploratory analysis.

PostgreSQL: Centralized data storage.

Power BI: Interactive dashboarding and reporting.

# 🔄 Data Pipeline

Raw CSV ➔ Python (Cleaning & Logic) ➔ PostgreSQL Database ➔ Power BI Dashboard

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The top ribbon across the dashboard displays critical metrics with sparklines to show trends over time:

***Total Patients:***  Tracks total ER visits (e.g., 9,216 visits in the consolidated view).

***Avg Wait Time:*** Monitors the efficiency of care (e.g., 35.3 Minutes).

***Patient Satisfaction Score:*** Average rating out of 10 (e.g., 4.97).

***Patients Referred:*** The count of patients transferred to other departments (e.g., 3,679).

# 📈 Dashboard Features

The Power BI report consists of three main views:

***Consolidated View:*** High-level KPIs (Total Patients, Avg Wait Time, Satisfaction Score).

***Monthly View:*** Slicers to filter data by year and month for seasonal analysis.

***Patient Details:*** A tabular view for auditing specific patient records and admission status.

***Key Takeaways:*** details about the project.

#  Conclusion

This project successfully transformed raw hospital records into an interactive analytical tool. By integrating Python for data quality and Power BI for visual reporting, the solution provides hospital administrators with the ability to optimize staffing during peak hours (via the heatmaps) and improve patient satisfaction by monitoring wait-time targets.
